Game rules

1. At the start, Simon's game will randomly give you a signal ( one color will pop up).

2. You have to repeat the signal by pressing the same color. 

3. Simon will duplicate the first signal and add a random one. 

4. You need to repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in the order.

5. Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

6. You need to repeat these three signals in the order.

7. Simon will repeat all three signals and add one.

8. Continue playing as long as you can repeat the sequence.

9. If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a "REZZ" sound.  That means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends. GAME OVER.
